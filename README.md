# Leveraging-Federated-Learning-for-Privacy-Preserving-IoMT-devices
Project Overview
This project explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) into Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices to enhance privacy and security while maintaining performance in real-world healthcare applications. The study investigates human stress recognition, human activity recognition, and secure data processing in wearable health monitoring devices.
Introduction
Wearable IoMT devices collect vast amounts of user health data, often raising privacy concerns. This project proposes using Federated Learning to train models on decentralized data without exposing individual user information.
Problem Statement
Data Privacy Risks – IoMT devices transmit sensitive health data to cloud servers, leading to potential privacy breaches.
High Communication Overhead – Transmitting raw data increases latency and security vulnerabilities.
Regulatory Compliance – Adhering to GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy regulations requires secure data handling.
Solution Approach
Implement Federated Learning to process data locally on edge devices.
Develop Deep Learning models for:
Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
Human Stress Detection
Utilize pruned and optimized models for IoMT devices.
Ensure secure communication between IoMT devices and servers.
